# free-sfx
A 100% Free Sfx package to play with

---

Why I created this package?
---
I'm not a sound designer (and don't pretend to be), but as a video editor (for 15+ years) I work with sound every single day. I created this sound package because I needed to play with sound to learn and experiment audio in a web environment. As I didn't find any totally free sfx without complicated license, I decided to create this one and share it.

It's still work in progress, and again more for training / experimenting (than real production, but of course you can use it as you like). I hope it could be helpful.

Content
---
The sound are available in AIFF, MP3 and OGG files. They are organized in folders, as follow:

- Alert
- Input
- Music
- SciFi
- Woosh
- Voice


I'm gonna try to keep updating this library with new sounds every once in a while.

You are free to use, share, modify and do whatever you want with this package or any part of it in any personal, open-source or commercial work without obligation of payment (monetary or otherwise) or attribution. You even can host the set.

As I want it to be open as it can be, the only thing **you are not allowed to do** is SELLING or RENTING (either in existing or modified form). Let's keep the web as open-source as we can.
